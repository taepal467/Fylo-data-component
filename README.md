## My process
I began by structuring the layout HTML.
Then, I started working on the styling for mobile devices.
Lastly, I created a reponsive scss partial to create the layout for medium and large devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned about how to rotate an element using CSS. I had to rotate the tooltip vertically by using rotateY() CSS function.


### Continued development

I need to work on my layout skills. Secondly, I need to work on how to make the web page displayed the same in all browsers. When I work on the projects, some of the challenges works in all browsers while some only work in Google Chrome.
